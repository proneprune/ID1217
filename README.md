Intended learning outcomes

After passing the course, the student should be able to

    compare and contrast programming models and paradigms for shared memory and distributed memory to choose the most appropriate models and the paradigms for a given problem
    justify, illustrate and explain the need of synchronisation in a concurrently executing programme
    explain, compare, choose and use the different synchronisation mechanisms in a concurrently executing programme
    explain, compare, choose and use different communication mechanisms for process interaction in distributed programmes
    implement concurrently executing and distributed programmes in C, Java or other programming languages by means of various programming environments such as pthreads, openMP, Java threads and monitors, Socket API, MPI and Java RMI
    evaluate, measure and estimate speed, performance and scalability and analyse safety and liveness properties for parallel and distributed programmes

in order to

    acquire knowledge in the basics of concurrent programming, more specifically about programming models, concepts, paradigms, techniques, synchronisation and communication mechanisms
    develop practical skills and experience in programming environments for developing parallel and distributed programmes
